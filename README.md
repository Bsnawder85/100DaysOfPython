# 100DaysOfPython
This is my code for the 100 Days of Code online course by Angela Yu on Udemy.

I expect to take much longer than 100 days to complete this course; perhaps a year at most. This project is an opportunity to dive further into my favorite programming language, and display my learning publicly.

This course covers a wide range of beginner to advanced, including:
- Turtle graphics
- Files and Directories
- Tkinter GUI
- Working with JSON data
- Email
- Creating and working with API endpoints 
- Authentication and Environment variables
- Web development with Flask and Jinja
- Web scraping using Beautiful Soup
- Web forms with WTForms
- Databases, with SQLite and SQLAlchemy
- Deploying web applications to Heroku
- Working with and visualizing data with Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn and Plotly

The course ends with several Professional Portfolio Projects, which I will post on their own repositories.
