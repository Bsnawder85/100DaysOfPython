# 100DaysOfPython
This is my code for the 100 Days of Code online course by Angela Yu on Udemy.

I expect to take much longer than 100 days to complete this course; perhaps a year at most. This project is an opportunity to dive further into my favorite programming language, and display my learning publicly.
